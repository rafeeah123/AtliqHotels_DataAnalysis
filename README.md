# Atliq Hotels Data Analysis Project Using Python and Pandas

## Problem Statement 

AtliQ Grands, a leading player in the hospitality industry, aims to reverse a decline in market share and revenue. The company plans to achieve this by analyzing historical hotel data from May 2022 to June 2022. Using Python and Pandas, the objective is to extract insights regarding customer ratings, occupancy rates, revenue, and bookings.

## Tasks

### 1.Data Import and Exploration

Imported required datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, trends, and correlations between variables, employed visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and potential patterns. Explored key variables within each dataset individually, examining their summary statistics, distributions, and relationships. This process provided a comprehensive understanding of the data characteristics, enabling informed decision-making and guiding subsequent analysis steps.

### 2.Data Cleaning
Outliers were managed by calculating the higher and lower limits based on standard deviation, allowing for the identification and subsequent handling of data points outside these bounds.Null values were addressed through filtering or by replacing them with mean and median values, ensuring data completeness and reliability for further analysis.

### 3.Data Transformation
Conducted data transformation by merging datasets based on common identifiers, facilitating the creation of enriched datasets with combined information from multiple sources.
Implemented feature engineering to create new columns by extracting relevant information from existing variables or by combining them to capture additional insights, enhancing the predictive power of machine learning models.

### 4.Insights Generation
Generated actionable insights from the data analysis process, uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations that informed strategic decision-making and optimization efforts.
Leveraged data-driven insights to identify areas for improvement, refine business strategies, and drive performance enhancements, ultimately maximizing the value derived from the dataset.


## Learnings

Through the project, gained proficiency in Python programming and Pandas library, mastering data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering techniques, enhancing analytical skills and understanding of real-world data challenges.
Learned the importance of data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation in extracting meaningful insights from raw datasets using Python and Pandas, highlighting the significance of thorough data understanding for informed decision-making in subsequent analysis tasks.
